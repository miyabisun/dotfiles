# Claude Code Global Rules

## Language

- Always respond in Japanese

## Git

- Commit messages must always be written in English
- Use Conventional Commits format (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`)
- NEVER commit unless the user explicitly instructs you to

## Design

- Follow the Unix philosophy (do one thing well, compose small tools, keep it simple)
